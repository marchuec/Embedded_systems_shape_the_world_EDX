Test EXecute, And Simulate, called <span style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span>,
is a collection of DLL
plugins that transform Keil uVision into learning environment for
embedded systems. These plugins provide simulation of the Texas
Instruments Tiva LaunchPad.
The suite also includes a stand-alone application called TExaSdisplay, which provides a serial port interface. 
When operating with the code embedded on the microcontroller, TExaSdisplay also provides a oscilloscope functionality. 
 Furthermore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span> can be used for
automatic grading of labs both in simulation and on the real board.<br>

This is version 2.23, built July 2, 2018 and includes all software for
the course. This version
was rebuilt without SSE2 so it should run on vintage PCs with AthlonXP or PIII processors.<br>
